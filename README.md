# TFG: Impact of Memory/Long-Memory in Large Language Models

## Project Overview
This Bachelor's thesis project investigates the impact of different memory mechanisms in Large Language Models by comparing various systems using multiple datasets.

## Research Question
How do different memory architectures affect the performance of LLMs on long-context tasks?

## Datasets
- **LongMemEval**: Long-term memory evaluation benchmark


## Current Status
- ✅ Literature review in progress
- ⏳ Dataset analysis (next step)
- ⏳ Baseline implementation
- ⏳ Memory system comparison

## Structure
- `research/` - Literature and reference materials
- `work/` - Active project development
- `notes.md` - Research notes and ideas

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the datasets in detail
2. Define comparison methodology
3. Implement baseline models
4. Design memory system experiments
